            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
              This website was developed in order to fulfill our college
              assignment. When we were asked to find a problem around us, we
              look at ourselves. Most of our member are animal lovers, and for
              some of them, it's hard to find a reliable source to start
              adopting an animal, and it's even harder to get information on how
              to take care of animals. Another problem is when someone want
              their pet to live somewhere else or with someone else, or to
              simply give them away. These problems didn't just happen to them,
              many people out there struggle with similiar problem
            </p>
            <p>
              That is exactly why we developed this website, in order for people
              to be able to easily adopt a pet, learn how to take care of them,
              and to be able to put them for adoption for them to live in a
              better place. While developing this website we hoped that this
              will be a solution for people who are struggling with this
              propblem.
